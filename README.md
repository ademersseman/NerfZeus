Included in this repository are my files for a nerf zeus I have painted and wired up to an arduino to increase functionality.

Also included are the <a href="https://github.com/ademersseman/NerfZeus/tree/main/NerfZeusOOP">files</a> for an object oriented approach to this problem. Unfortunately the object oriented approach is unfinished and will be revisited at a later date as the LCD screen looks like this under the current implementation. This may look like it is caused by electric noise but alas a functional implementation of LCD control as it appears in this repository functions flawlessly.![IMG_1272](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38081126/169588125-8101f675-aefb-4f70-af85-870e87a8a555.jpg)
