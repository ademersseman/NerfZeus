# NerfZeus
Included in this repository are my files for a nerf zeus I have painted and wired up to an arduino to increase functionality.
## Features

## Implementation
* [CNC cut](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/z72jtO_NJdo) slits for [LCD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvk_KqMDpkA), LED strip, and the lightning bolt LED
* Sanded, [primed](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0876DM8L8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), [hydrodipped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM9zkxGlZ6o), then [clear-coated](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ZLQKQG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1)

## The future
Also included are the [files](https://github.com/ademersseman/NerfZeus/tree/main/NerfZeusOOP) for an object oriented approach to this problem. Unfortunately, the object oriented approach is unfinished and will be revisited at a later date as the LCD screen looks like this under the current implementation. This may look like it is caused by electric noise but alas a functional implementation of LCD control as it appears in this repository functions flawlessly.![IMG_1272](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38081126/169588125-8101f675-aefb-4f70-af85-870e87a8a555.jpg)
